#### Impact of News and Severe Climate Events on Food Security: Transportation Networks Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for research on how severe climate events and news reports impact food security, particularly through disruptions in the transportation networks that supply food. The project focuses on key infrastructure channels, including:

Road networks
Railroads
Major seaports
The research investigates how the transportation of food is affected by climate events (such as hurricanes, floods, or droughts) and major news reports that may drive changes in policies, market behavior, or logistics. We aim to provide insights into the vulnerability of food supply chains, exploring the relationship between news-driven public perception and the physical limitations posed by environmental conditions.

Analysis leverages the NewsCatcher API  
## https://newscatcherapi.com/ to extract news information.
 

## The primary goals of this project are to:

Assess the impact of climate events: Examine how severe weather or environmental changes disrupt the transportation of food on roads, railroads, and through seaports.
Analyze news-driven disruptions: Study how significant news reports related to policy changes, climate impacts, or economic shifts influence food security.
Identify critical transportation nodes: Highlight key routes, railways, and seaports that are most vulnerable to disruptions.
